# CN1-Compatlib

This library allows you to develop against portions of the Codename One API from a regular JavaSE or JavaEE project.  The goal of this project is to improve source code reuse between all of your Java projects.

## License

GPL with Classpath Exception

## Installation

Just add the [cn1-compatlib.jar](https://github.com/shannah/cn1-compatlib/releases/tag/3.3) to your Java project's classpath.  Then you can use core codename one APIs directly in your project.

## Status

Currently only the com.codename1.util package is included.  This importantly includes `StringUtil` and `MathUtil` which are probably the most common classes you need to use in Codename One.
